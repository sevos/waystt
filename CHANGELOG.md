## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-25

### Added
- Initial release of waystt - Wayland Speech-to-Text Tool
- Signal-driven speech-to-text with dual output modes:
  - SIGUSR1: Direct text typing via ydotool 
  - SIGUSR2: Clipboard copy for manual pasting
- OpenAI Whisper API integration for high-quality transcription
- Continuous background audio recording with PipeWire/CPAL
- Musical audio feedback system with configurable beeps:
  - Recording start: "Ding dong" (C4 → E4)
  - Recording stop: "Dong ding" (E4 → C4)
  - Success: "Ding ding" (E4 → E4)
  - Error: Warbling tone for failures
- Persistent clipboard daemon for clipboard operations
- Comprehensive configuration via environment variables
- Support for multiple audio backends (PipeWire, PulseAudio, ALSA)
- Cross-platform Wayland compatibility (tested on Hyprland, Niri)
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks and retry mechanisms

### System Requirements
